                The Synergy Way is a repository of best practices intended to help our development teams build consistent and high quality code. 
                As we deliver many digital services using open source frameworks and libraries, it is our intent that others may find these practices 
                a helpful case study for their own team development environments. 
            </p>
            <p>
                We also post our coding style guides here for reference. Inspired by <a href="https://pages.18f.gov/guides" target="_blank">18F Guides</a>, 
                it is also our hope that other digital service teams will find this information valuable.
